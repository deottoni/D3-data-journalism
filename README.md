## Task

### Level 1: D3 Dabbler

I've created a scatter plot between two of the data variables, `Obesity vs. Poverty`.

Using D3 techniques, I create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. This graphic was coded in the `app.js` file of this repoâ€” using in the data from `data.csv` by using the `d3.csv` function. 

* Included state abbreviations in the circles.

* Created and situated the axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

* Note: Use `python -m http.server` to run the visualization. This will host the page at `localhost:8000` in the web browser.

#### 1. More Data, More Dynamics

In this step, I've included more demographics and more factors, placed additional labels in my X Axis and gave them click events. I've also animated the transitions for the circles' locations, its state labels, as well as the range of the X axis. 


#### 2. Incorporate d3-tip

I've introduced 'on hover' tooltips for the circles with information on State name, and the respecive data.
